This project is based on machine learning using Neural Networks and written in the Python programming language. The idea for undertaking this project stems from me wanting to figure out how uniquely different neural networks function. There are various types of neural networks that I could have utilized in my project but after researching my options I chose to work with the three most widely used neural networks. The three Neural Networks I chose to work with were Multilayer perceptron, Convolutional neural network (CNN) and k-nearest Neighbours (KNN). 


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To run the Python Program You need to Install the Following to your Machine

```

```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Download the Anaconda installer from https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#windows
Double click the installer to launch
```
