This project is based on machine learning using Neural Networks and written in the Python programming language. The idea for undertaking this project stems from me wanting to figure out how uniquely different neural networks function. There are various types of neural networks that I could have utilized in my project but after researching my options I chose to work with the three most widely used neural networks. The three Neural Networks I chose to work with were Multilayer perceptron, Convolutional neural network (CNN) and k-nearest Neighbours (KNN). 


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To run the Python Program You need to Install the Following to your Machine

```
Download the Anaconda installer from https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#windows
Double click the installer to launch
```

</p>

We also need to install few Python Modules that do not come pre-installed. These can be installed using PIP.

```
pymongo
pip install pymongo

dnspython
pip install dnspython

keras
pip install keras

tensorflow
pip install tensorflow

opencv
pip install opencv-python
```

### Installing

Inside Your Bash/Terminal Copy And Paste This
```bash
Git clone https://github.com/nakster/FashionNeuralNetwork.git

Change Into the Directory
cd "Location\FashionNeuralNetwork"

Run Python Program
Python main.c // this will run the whole programme 

Sign-up/login 

After login you cas use between the 3 different types of neural networks 
```
